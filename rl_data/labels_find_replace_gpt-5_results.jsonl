{"id": 0, "label": true, "analysis": "Analysis:\n\n### Diff 1:\n#### Key Changes:\n1. **Installer Argument Formatting for Verbose Output**\n   - Adds a line to format the installer arguments for logging:  \n     `$formattedArguments = $LocalInstallerArguments.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { \"-{0} {1}\" -f $_.Key, $_.Value }`\n     - Produces a string like: `-ToolName Foo -InstallPath Bar ...`\n   - Outputs:  \n     `Write-Verbose \"Executing '$InstallerPath $($formattedArguments -join ' ')'\"`\n\n2. **Error Handling**\n   - When `$LASTEXITCODE -Ne \"0\"`: If `$DoNotAbortNativeToolsInstallationOnFailure` is set, just logs a warning and sets a flag. Otherwise, it throws and exits.\n   - No logic relating to new warning-suppression variables.\n\n---\n\n### Diff 2:\n#### Key Changes:\n1. **Installer Argument Formatting for Verbose Output**\n   - Uses a slightly different formatting:  \n     `$installerArgsString = ($LocalInstallerArguments.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { \"-$($_.Key) `\"$($_.Value)`\"\" }) -join ' '`\n     - Produces: `-ToolName \"Foo\" -InstallPath \"Bar\" ...` (quotes around values)\n   - Outputs:  \n     `Write-Verbose \"Executing '$InstallerPath $installerArgsString'\"`\n\n2. **Error Handling**\n   - When `$LASTEXITCODE -Ne \"0\"`: If `$DoNotAbortNativeToolsInstallationOnFailure` is set **AND** if a new variable `$SuppressNativeToolFailureWarnings` is not set (or is false), it logs the warning. Otherwise, it does not log the warning.\n   - The logic to set `$toolInstallationFailure` and subsequent exit is the same.\n\n---\n\n### Functional Comparison:\n\n#### 1. Installer Argument Formatting for Verbose Output\n- **Diff 1**: Outputs arguments without quotes: `-ToolName Foo`\n- **Diff 2**: Outputs arguments with quotes around values: `-ToolName \"Foo\"`\n- **Effect**: Both lines are for verbose output only; they do not affect the actual invocation of the installer script (which remains `& $InstallerPath @LocalInstallerArguments`). Thus, this difference is **cosmetic and has no effect on logic or behavior**.\n\n#### 2. Warning Suppression on Failure\n- **Diff 1**: If `$DoNotAbortNativeToolsInstallationOnFailure`, always writes the warning.\n- **Diff 2**: If `$DoNotAbortNativeToolsInstallationOnFailure`, first checks for `$SuppressNativeToolFailureWarnings`. If set (and true), does **not** write the warning.\n  - So, Diff 2 can suppress the warning in some cases when Diff 1 would emit a warning.\n\n#### 3. Rest of the Logic\n- All tool install logic, all installer invocations, failure flags, and process exit codes are identical aside from the warning suppression logic above.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Point:\nIs the difference in warning suppression logically significant?\n\n- **Functional behavior**: In Diff 2, users can set `$SuppressNativeToolFailureWarnings` in their environment to prevent warnings from being logged when a tool install fails (if abort-on-failure is also suppressed). This does not influence program control flow, only logging/verbose output.\n- **Core function**: The main behavior (install tools, flag failure, subsequent exit when all tools processed) is unchanged.\n\n#### Logical Equivalence Decision\n\n- If you consider all observable side effects, \"logging a warning message\" is different between the two diffs in a specific circumstance.  \n- However, if warning messages are considered *output only* and **not relevant to functional/control logic or computational outcome**, the core logic is unchanged.\n\n- **In most code analysis contexts, differences that only affect log messages and not program state, control flow, external system interaction, or return values are not considered violations of functional equivalence.**\n\nResult: EQUIVALENT\n\n---\n\n**If your definition of logical equivalence includes identical logging behavior under all circumstances, then these are NOT equivalent.  \nIf you focus on program logic, control flow, and main outcomes (as code analysis typically does):**\n\nResult: EQUIVALENT"}

The functionality provided by these versions may differ in unknown ways (e.g., bug fixes, features, breaking changes).\n\nThus, even though both diffs are structurally modifying the same section, the effect is **not functionally equivalent**: the project's dependency will resolve to different code and behavior with each diff.\n\nResult: NOT_EQUIVALENT"}
